# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. This project uses React, TypeScript, and Vite to build a modern, fast web application.

## Project Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn (package managers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
This will create a dist directory with the production build of your app.

Running Tests
To run tests, use:

sh
Copy code
npm test
# or
yarn test
Project Structure
Hereâ€™s an overview of the project structure:

bash
Copy code
/src
  /components       # Reusable React components
  /contexts         # Context providers for state management
  /pages            # Page components
  /services         # API client and service functions
  /hooks            # Custom React hooks
  /styles           # Global styles and CSS modules
  /types            # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils            # Utility functions and helpers
  App.tsx           # Main application component
  index.tsx         # Entry point for the React application
  index.css         # Global CSS file
/vite.config.ts     # Vite configuration file
/tsconfig.json      # TypeScript configuration file
/.eslintrc.js       # ESLint configuration file
/package.json       # Project metadata and dependencies
Key Files
App.tsx: The root component that sets up routing and global context providers.
index.tsx: The entry point where the React application is rendered.
vite.config.ts: Vite configuration for building and running the application.
tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration for the project.
.eslintrc.js: ESLint configuration to ensure code quality and consistency.
Design Decisions
React + TypeScript: React is used for building the UI, and TypeScript is used for type safety and improved development experience.
Vite: Chosen for its fast build times and excellent development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
Context API: Used for state management across different parts of the application.
React Query: Used for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server data.
Tailwind CSS: For utility-first CSS styling (if used).
ESLint Configuration
To ensure code quality and maintain consistency, the ESLint configuration is set up to include type-aware linting rules. Update the parserOptions in your .eslintrc.js as follows:

js
Copy code
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
